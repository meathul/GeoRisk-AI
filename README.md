# GeoRisk AI

## Overview

This project is a demonstrating a **multi-agent system** that leverages **IBM watsonx.ai** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide climate-aware risk analysis for business risk.  
It enables businesses to make informed decisions by assessing weather risks and historical climate data relevant to key supply chain points.
